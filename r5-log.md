## Day 1 - Monday, 3 Apr 2023

### Round 5 Thought:
- I was slack last 2 weeks (because of some good news!). I coded here and there but not everyday and not very long hours per session.
- Again, can't believe I can't persist after the 1st round. 
- But Round 5 lezzgo! I will try my best!
- Again, for this round, I will put a target for myself for every 7 days and see how it goes.

### Target for 3 Apr 2023 - 9 Apr 2023
**Main Focus**

1. Python Intro - GA Full-Time & Flex course 

**Later focus**
1. Data Structure & Algorithm (to write better code in efficiency)
2. Resume React (React is everywhere!)
3. APIs (fundamental thing!)


### Today's Progress:
- One of my ex-coursemate joined me today. We started Python together!
- Learnt about basis stuffs like What is Python, its primitive data types, how to do loops, declaring variables, operators, etc.

### Thoughts:
- Felt good to start Python. Challenged my brain. 
- Also guided my ex-coursemate. Pushed myself harder to understand every piece of code or knowledge I know about Python so I can explain better.

### Link to work:
- No link. All codes in my VS Code

### Today's Progress:
- Learned about Python modules.
- In summary, Python modules is just a Python file where you put all the reusable code in it.
- In order to use it, you need to import it.
- 2 types of modules- built-in modules & user-defined modules.

### Thoughts:
- Doing good so far. But... feel something wrong, like I'm repeating the same study pattern...

### Link to work:
- VSCode.
