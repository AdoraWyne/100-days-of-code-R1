## Day 1 - Monday, 3 Apr 2023

### Round 5 Thought:
- I was slack last 2 weeks (because of some good news!). I coded here and there but not everyday and not very long hours per session.
- Again, can't believe I can't persist after the 1st round. 
- But Round 5 lezzgo! I will try my best!
- Again, for this round, I will put a target for myself for every 7 days and see how it goes.

### Target for 3 Apr 2023 - 9 Apr 2023
**Main Focus**

1. Python Intro - GA Full-Time & Flex course 

**Later focus**
1. Data Structure & Algorithm (to write better code in efficiency)
2. Resume React (React is everywhere!)
3. APIs (fundamental thing!)


### Today's Progress:
- One of my ex-coursemate joined me today. We started Python together!
- Learnt about basis stuffs like What is Python, its primitive data types, how to do loops, declaring variables, operators, etc.

### Thoughts:
- Felt good to start Python. Challenged my brain. 
- Also guided my ex-coursemate. Pushed myself harder to understand every piece of code or knowledge I know about Python so I can explain better.

### Link to work:
- No link. All codes in my VS Code

### Today's Progress:
- Learned about Python modules.
- In summary, Python modules is just a Python file where you put all the reusable code in it.
- In order to use it, you need to import it.
- 2 types of modules- built-in modules & user-defined modules.

### Thoughts:
- Doing good so far. But... feel something wrong, like I'm repeating the same study pattern...

### Today's Progress:
- Finished Flex W7D2 exercise. 

### Thoughts:
- The exercise was alright. I tried to list down all the steps I need to do to train myself, and also better clarity as well (i.e. I know exactly what I need to do, or why I did that)

### Today's Progress:
- Learn Strings methods & Lists in depth.

### Thoughts:
Something was blowing my mind:
I have 2 lists and I need to combine them into 1 list calls `heroes`:
```python
planeteers = ['Earth', 'Wind', 'Captain Planet', 'Fire', 'Water']
rangers = ['Red', 'Blue', 'Fuchsia', 'Pink', 'Yellow', 'Green', 'Black']

# I was using extend() method but this is much better!
heroes = [*planeteers, *rangers]

# The asterisk * is used to unpack the elements of the lists, which means that the individual elements of each list will be included in the new list heroes without the list brackets.

```

### Today's Progress:
- Learnt how to read line by line in Python. 
- Python has in-built method to read 2 types of files - text file and binary file.
- `readlines()` & `readline()`, using along with `strip()` which to remove the `\n` at the end of each line.

- Learnt new way to print with variable and also multiple lines: using `'''` and `format()`:
```python
a = 'a'
b = 'b'
c ='c'

print('''
Line 1: {},
Line 2: {},
Line 3: {}
'''.format(a,b,c))

# Output:
#
# Line 1: a,
# Line 2: b,
# Line 3: c
# 

# Example 2:
print('''Line 1: {},
Line 2: {},
Line 3: {}'''.format(a,b,c))

# Output:
# Line 1: a,
# Line 2: b,
# Line 3: c
```

- Also redo the shopping cart exercise in a different way.

### Thoughts:
- It was chill.

### Today's Progress:
- Did some flex course homework.
- Studied what is [client server architecture](https://intellipaat.com/blog/what-is-client-server-architecture/)?
- It's similar to what I ady knew about client-server stuff but added more:
- What are the examples for client server architecture (networking computing model or client server network), it consists what components.\, the types.

### Thoughts:
- Feels like my Python skill is getting better

### Today's Progress:
- Learned `try...except` in Python.
```python
try:
    b = int('Vishal')
    print(b)
except:
    print('Error') # will print this instead

# # =======================================================

try:
    b = int('Vishal')
    print(b)
except Exception as e: # consider Exception as variable, 'as' is keyword
    print(e) # invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'Vishal'
    # print("Error, cant convert")
    # print(Exception.args) # return : <attribute 'args' of 'BaseException' objects>
    # print(Exception) # return : <class 'Exception'>, we should not use this
```

- Learned about web component:
- For port: we normally don't see port number on website as 80, 443 - replaced by http, https.

| Component        | Value      |
| -------------   |:-------------:|
| Scheme        | http |
| Authority      | www.mywebsite.com    |
| Port | 80 or 443      |
| Path(to index.html resource) | /src/pages/index.html |
| Parameters or Query Parameters | ?name=Vishal&age=36 |
| Anchor | #some-element-id-in-html |

### Thoughts:
- Learned more about web components.
