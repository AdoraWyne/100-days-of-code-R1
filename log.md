# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 4th Feb 2023, Day 1

**Today's Progress**: Learnt basic Bootstrap- Card, Grid & Conditional Rendering & toggle function on md.

**Before Thoughts:** 
1. I decided to join this challenges without publicly announce it on Twitter. I'm excited. The hardest at this moment would be I doubt I will able to just do purely coding for an hour without counting together the time spent on tutorial or reading but I will try my best.  
2. First day, I decided to continue learning React that I've been doing in the last few days. Will learn:
  * Rendering lists
  * Conditional Rendering

**After Thoughts:** 
1. Used Bootsrap to style my Pokemon exercise. It's a lot harder than Tailwind in my opinion. Used Bootstrap's Card & Grid system to style. Also need to use double {} when we use style attribute in JSX. 
2. Learnt Conditional Rendering: ```if...else``` statement, Ternary Operator and Logical Operator.
3. Special note for Logical Operator, you **CANNOT** put numbers (ZERO) on the left side of &&, otherwise React will render ZERO.
The below example, will render as 0
```
const Component = () => {
const count = 0
 return (
  <>
   {count && <p>Testing!</p>}
  </>
 )
 ```
 4. Also <details> tag (+ closing tag) for [markdown toggle](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/j1770s/heres_how_to_create_a_toggle_switch_in_markdown/).

 ### Day 1: 5th Feb 2023, Day 2

**Today's Progress**: Continue with Conditional Rendering. Did a weather exercise and did some vanilla CSS styling to it. 

**Thoughts:** 
1. I had some trouble to do the Weather Forecast exercise. Couldnt get the Switch stmt working but got it worked eventually. But still my skill is abit rusty.
2. Felt good to use vanilla CSS to style this. 1 thing I will take out from this is how to add background-image and how to make background-image not repeating and cover.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
