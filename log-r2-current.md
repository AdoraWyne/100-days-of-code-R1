# 100 Days Of Code - Log
<details>

### Saturday, 25 Feb 2023 (DELETED)

Round 2 first thought: I was failed at day 21. I'll try my best for this round! DONT GIVE UP CHIN YING!!

**Today's Progress:**
- I did a coding challenge yesterday and tried to write a test but I got into error and error & I was able to solve it today. This [article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59443525/require-not-working-in-module-type-nodejs-script) saved me.
- Did an OOP coding challenge. I will do more OOP coding challenges from now on.

**Thoughts:**
- `require` & `import` are from different "version" of JS. 
- `require` is from **CommonJS-like Node.js native modules** & `import` is from **ESM (JavaScript modules, type = "module")**

- Date.toString() will return returns a string representing the specified Date object interpreted in the **local timezone**.

### Day 1 - Monday, 27 Feb 2023

**Today's Progress:**
- Still a bit weak today but I think I finally getting better...*happy tears
- I'm dedicated to finish the Vitest course on Udemy this week! Because I'm still a bit weak. I rewatched the lessons from the beginning, but did not watch much. Hopefully I'll get to the new lesson tomorrow.

**Thoughts:**
- Did not know there is differences between `Number()` & `parseInt()`. Check [this](https://thisthat.dev/number-constructor-vs-parse-int/#:~:text=Number()%20converts%20the%20type%20whereas%20parseInt%20parses%20the%20value%20of%20input.&text=As%20you%20see%2C%20parseInt%20will,to%20convert%20the%20entire%20string.) out!

**Link to work:** 
- No links to work. I worked the testing stuff on VS Code & wrote notes on Notion.

### Day 2 - Tueday, 28 Feb 2023

**Today's Progress:**
1. Started my day with CodeWars, of course! Kyu 6 and I solved in 20mins! ðŸ¤© But I find a bit clueless when tried to refactoring the code. Need to do some research/study about this.
2. Continuing with Vitest testing, re-learnt about testing error.

### Day 4 - Thursday, 02 Mar 2023

**Today's Progress:**
- Continue with the testing Udemy course.
- Prepared for behavioural questions.

**Thoughts:**
- I could not really focus on coding today. My mind was all about behavioural interview.

### Day 5 - Friday, 03 Mar 2023
- I missed today, was doing OOP coding challenge and was watching Udemy course about prototype.
- Then, was busying prepared for behavioural questions, practiced with Max, talked with AK. Then headed off to work for the rest of the day.
- I have no execuse.

### Day 6 - Saturday, 03 Mar 2023
- IA-ing today. 
- After IA, was watching Udemy course again for testing. Did some testing code. But I won't count today because I dont think that's 1 hour enough.

---

### Day 1 - Sunday, 05 Mar 2023

**Today's Progress:**
- Finally get into Spies & Mocks, but it's hard to understand :(
- Need to watch the video again.

**Thoughts:**
- It's bit hard to grasp spies & mocks concept. 


**Link to work:** 
- Notes in my notion. 
- Code in my VSCode.

---

### Day 2 - Monday, 6 Mar 2023

**Today's Progress:**
- Had pair-programming with Dylan and realised how bad I am trying to explain my code. 
- While tried to understand Spies & Mocks, I also jumped intn JS basic today a little bit. 
- Learnt about a new JS data type - `bigInt`, `use strict`.
- Wrote some test for super simple coding challenge and also in TS & Python & Ruby (my first Ruby code!)

**Thoughts:**
- I purposely chose a really simple coding challenge to practice my unit testing code, and also TS, Python. 
- Then, I was like "why not Ruby?!". Had a quick look at Ruby function syntax.
- The coding challenge was just to create a `greet` function to return 'hello world!'

###### In TS:
```ts
function greet(): string {
 return 'hello world!'
}
```
###### In Python:
```python
def greet():
 return 'hello world!'
```
###### In Ruby:
```ruby
def greet()
 return 'hello world!'
end
```

- Had too much fun on writting code in different languages, so I tried another simple coding challenge- IF ELSE statement
###### In TS:
```ts
const boolToWord = (bool: boolean): string => {
 return bool ? "Yes" : "No"
}
```

###### In Python:
```python
# My answer:
def bool_to_word(boolean):
 if boolean:
     return 'Yes'
 else:
     return 'No'

# But it can be:
def bool_to_word(bool):
  return "Yes" if bool else "No"
```

###### In Ruby:
```ruby
def greet bool
 bool ? "Yes" : "No"
end
```

## Day 1 - Friday, 10 Mar 2023

### Round 4 Thought:
- Can't believe I can't persist after the first round. Was focusing on interview and personal life. But Round 4 let's go! I will try my best!
- Also realised my study has been jumping around here and there. For this round, I will put a target for myself for every 7 days and see how it goes. (Hope it helps me to complete the courses I want to learn!)

### Target for 10 Mar 2023 - 16 Mar 2023
**Main Focus**

1. Vitest - Spies & Mock (Learning testing)
2. Keeping up with Flex course - DOM (familiar with it again so I can help the students better)
3. Spend 1 hour doing coding challenges (Maybe do it at the start of my day). If it's an easy one, try in TS, Python & Ruby. (Practice so my skill wont get rusty)

**Later focus**
1. Data Structure & Algorithm (to write better code in efficiency)
2. Resume React (React is everywhere!)
3. APIs (fundamental thing!)


### Today's Progress:
- DOM: Learnt new way to insert new element into HTML: `document.body.insertAdjacentElement("afterend", p)`
- I experimented around and see what will happen if I added new <p> before or after <body>. If it still works!
- This is what ChatGPT said:
> The side effect of inserting the **`<p>`** element in this way is that it is not technically valid HTML according to the HTML specification, because elements are not allowed to be inserted directly after the **`<body>`** element. According to the HTML specification, only whitespace and comments are allowed in this position.

> However, in practice, modern web browsers are often able to handle non-standard HTML like this without any issues. So while the code may work in your browser, it's not guaranteed to work in all browsers or on all devices.

> If you want to ensure that your HTML is valid and works across all devices, it's generally a good idea to follow the HTML specification as closely as possible. In this case, you could insert the **`<p>`** element inside the **`<body>`** element instead of after it.

### Thoughts:
- Feel so good to go through the Flex course. I was able to enjoy music while reading the course material and did the lab exercises/homeworks.

### Link to work:
- No link. All codes in my VS Code

## Day 2 - Saturday, 11 Mar 2023

### Today's Progress:
- Did flex course exercises & homework - focusing on Object & CSS.

### Thoughts:
- Feel good again about it.

### Link to work:
- No links.

--- 

## Day 3 - Sunday, 12 Mar 2023

### Today's Progress:
- I tried the OOP: Help Grinch steal Christmas from JS programmers again cuz I was not familiar with it. After trying and understanding the logic, I'm much better now to understand `Date` object. 

### Thoughts:
- Love the feeling of digging the code.

## Day 4 - Monday, 13 Mar 2023

### Today's Progress:
- Spent long time to figure out today's coding challenge. Eventually needed to look up the solution. (Only not sure about the swapping color method part). Had to use destructuring assignment.

## Day 5 - Tuesday, 14 Mar 2023

### Today's Progress:
- Was going to do 1 OOP coding challenge but I could not solve it. TwT . I will try again tomorrow. 
- Did some CSS revision: `position: relative, absolute` etc & flexbox! (that reminds me had panic attack when I first learned flexbox lmao, looking back now it was funny!)
- Learnt something new about **Inline element - vertical alignment** but still need to look more into it.

### Thoughts:
- OOP! It's hard but I think I started to get a hang of it.

### Link to work:
- [Freggy Frog](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)
- 8-IA/W4D1 folder - Did some CSS stuff there.

## Day 6 - Wednesday, 15 Mar 2023

### Today's Progress:
- Only did this coding challenge today. It was kyu 7 but took me a while to finish it.

### Thoughts:
- Not feeling today...

## Day 7 - Thursday, 16 Mar 2023

### Today's Progress:
- Watched Flexbox tutorial to understand more about `flex-basis`, `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink` and `order` as I wasnt not understand. 

### Thoughts:
- Clear about that now. Maybe can utilise it in the future, esp in Tailwind!

### Link to work:
- In my VS Code.



--- 

## Day 8 - Friday, 17 Mar 2023

### Today's Progress:
- Tried coding challenge on Codewars but with training Algorithms. 

### Thoughts:
- I was defeated! Could not solve. Still having error of running timeout.
