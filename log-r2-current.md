# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Saturday, 25 Feb 2023 (DELETED)

Round 2 first thought: I was failed at day 21. I'll try my best for this round! DONT GIVE UP CHIN YING!!

**Today's Progress:**
- I did a coding challenge yesterday and tried to write a test but I got into error and error & I was able to solve it today. This [article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59443525/require-not-working-in-module-type-nodejs-script) saved me.
- Did an OOP coding challenge. I will do more OOP coding challenges from now on.

**Thoughts:**
- `require` & `import` are from different "version" of JS. 
- `require` is from **CommonJS-like Node.js native modules** & `import` is from **ESM (JavaScript modules, type = "module")**

- Date.toString() will return returns a string representing the specified Date object interpreted in the **local timezone**.

### Day 1 - Monday, 27 Feb 2023

**Today's Progress:**
- Still a bit weak today but I think I finally getting better...*happy tears
- I'm dedicated to finish the Vitest course on Udemy this week! Because I'm still a bit weak. I rewatched the lessons from the beginning, but did not watch much. Hopefully I'll get to the new lesson tomorrow.

**Thoughts:**
- Did not know there is differences between `Number()` & `parseInt()`. Check [this](https://thisthat.dev/number-constructor-vs-parse-int/#:~:text=Number()%20converts%20the%20type%20whereas%20parseInt%20parses%20the%20value%20of%20input.&text=As%20you%20see%2C%20parseInt%20will,to%20convert%20the%20entire%20string.) out!

**Link to work:** 
- No links to work. I worked the testing stuff on VS Code & wrote notes on Notion.

**Today's Progress:**
1. Started my day with CodeWars, of course! Kyu 6 and I solved in 20mins! ðŸ¤© But I find a bit clueless when tried to refactoring the code. Need to do some research/study about this.
