# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1 - Saturday, 25 Feb 2023

Round 2 first thought: I was failed at day 21. I'll try my best for this round! DONT GIVE UP CHIN YING!!

**Today's Progress:**
- I did a coding challenge yesterday and tried to write a test but I got into error and error & I was able to solve it today. This [article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59443525/require-not-working-in-module-type-nodejs-script) saved me.
- Did an OOP coding challenge. I will do more OOP coding challenges from now on.

**Thoughts:**
- `require` & `import` are from different "version" of JS. 
- `require` is from **CommonJS-like Node.js native modules** & `import` is from **ESM (JavaScript modules, type = "module")**

- Date.toString() will return returns a string representing the specified Date object interpreted in the **local timezone**.

- I cant share my coding challenge nor my test.
